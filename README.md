[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/prodhe/gopher) 

A server hosting files, dirs and links according to the gopher protocol.

Because gopherspace deserves more servers.

Work in progress as a playground for basic networking in go. And readers,
writers, buffers, []byte and whatnot...
